# Problem Title
### SIH 1893: Smart Waste Management System for Urban Areas

# Problem Description
### Background: 
Urban areas are facing a mounting challenge in managing solid waste efficiently. Overflowing bins, irregular collection schedules, and lack of monitoring contribute to environmental pollution and health risks. The inefficiencies in current waste collection and segregation systems lead to increased operational costs and dissatisfaction among citizens.

# Description: 
The problem focuses on designing a smart waste management system that automates bin monitoring, optimizes collection routes, and promotes efficient waste segregation. The solution should include sensors to monitor bin fill levels, a real-time dashboard for municipal authorities, and a mobile application for citizens to report issues and view collection schedules. Key challenges include real-time data processing, system scalability, integration with municipal systems, and promoting behavioral change among citizens.

# Expected Solution:
The solution is expected to be an integrated platform including:

1.IoT-enabled smart bins that detect fill level and type of waste.

2.A centralized dashboard for authorities with real-time bin status and route optimization.

3.A mobile app for citizens to get alerts, provide feedback, and schedule pickups.

4.A data analytics module to improve efficiency and identify high-waste zones.

5.Support for segregated waste handling (biodegradable, recyclable, hazardous).

6.The system should aim to improve cleanliness, reduce manual monitoring efforts, enhance sustainability, and create an engaging experience for citizens and municipal staff.

# Problem Creator's Organization
### Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs

### Idea
Develop an intelligent waste management system using IoT and AI technologies that ensures timely waste collection, efficient route planning for waste trucks, and real-time citizen engagement through mobile applications and smart dashboards.

# Proposed Solution
A connected waste management ecosystem that includes:

### Smart Bins
1.Equipped with ultrasonic sensors for fill-level detection

2.Sends alerts when bin is full or emits odor

3.Supports waste type identification

### Citizen Mobile App
1.Shows bin status and nearby bin locations

2.Allows reporting of overflowing or damaged bins

3.Notifies users about collection schedules

4.Educational tips for segregation

### Municipal Dashboard
1.Displays real-time bin data on a map

2.Auto-generates optimal collection routes using AI

3.Provides analytics on waste trends

4.Alerts for maintenance and zone-wise heatmaps

### Waste Collection Trucks
1.Integrated with GPS for live tracking

2.Follows optimized routes

3.Sends feedback to dashboard after bin collection

# Use Cases
1.Citizen: Reports an overflowing bin using the app and receives a notification when itâ€™s cleared.

2.Municipal Officer: Views real-time data and redirects trucks for urgent pickups.

3.Truck Driver: Follows an AI-optimized route for efficient bin collection.

4.Administrator: Analyzes daily collection patterns and plans resource allocation.
